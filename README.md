# Fowsniff-Capture The Flag 🔱

Welcome to the world of ethical hacking, where curiosity meets challenge and every keystroke brings you closer to uncovering hidden vulnerabilities. In this Capture the Flag (CTF) adventure, nicknamed **"Fowsniff"**, I'll be stepping into the shoes of a cyber sleuth, navigating through layers of digital defenses to expose the secrets of a vulnerable machine. From port scanning and online sleuthing to cracking hashes and brute-forcing logins, this project is more than just a test of technical skills—it's a journey into the heart of cybersecurity. Join me as I unravel the complexities of **Fowsniff**, one flag at a time. 😁
